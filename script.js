I worked ${Fifth} for hours, attaching a ${Sixth} to a ${Seventh} using a ${Eighth}. Suddenly, it started ${Ninth}! To test it, I pressed the ${Tenth} ${Eleventh}, and it ${Twelth} across the room, landing in a pile of ${Thirteenth}. I called it the ${Fourteenth} and decided to show it to my ${Fifteenth}. They thought it was so ${Sixteenth} that they called the ${Sevententh} to share my invention with the world. Now, everyone uses my ${Sevententh} for ${Eightenth}, and I couldnâ€™t be more ${Ninetenth}!`
